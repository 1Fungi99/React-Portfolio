            I always dreamed about being an astronaut as a child, flying through
            the stars and adventuring the final frontier. Even with LEGOs, I
            have always looked to the Star Wars sets, imagining what is out
            there. The glisten that was in my eyes, looked like the stars itself
            full of curiosity and imagination of a child. Then one day, my
            father brought home a broken computer (Would not turn on). Me, full
            of precociousness, fiddled with the external wires. To my
            astonishment, I managed to allow power to surge through the computer
            once again. This sparked (Get it?) my interest in the technology
            field. Though, I did not know it this early. A nested interest in
            computers planted its seed in my mind. Now, as a college student,
            with a love for making computers has turned to the joys of software
            engineering. Coding through Collin Community College, The University
            of Texas at Arlington and currently Southern Methodist University.My
            specialties include quickly learning and applying recently new
            skills, concepts or programming languages, web development, and
            responsive website design. Always always looking for new principles,
            programming languages, or any frameworks to apply to my future
            works.
